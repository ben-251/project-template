Start writing "data" in report
Predict test data with models
Prices in the country of the dataset might not match the prices they would be here
Get rid of the variables we don't need
show our best model, and a model with all variables, and one with too few to compare adj.rsquared
write out model as linear equation and describe
residuals plots


Key IDS sills to demonstrate in the final project: (use as an outline for the report)
- Loading, processing and cleaning of data
- effective summarisations of the data in both numerical and visual forms
-Appropriate management of various variable types (specifically numerical and categorical)
- Evidence of effective communication throughnumerical output and visualsations
- Construction of an appropriate model (linear or logistic)
- Valid interpretations and assessments of model outputs
