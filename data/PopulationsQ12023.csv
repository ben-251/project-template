(1) Secure Children's Homes and Secure Training Centres data are a snapshot of the under 18 population and have been drawn from the Youth Justice Board's eAsset system. They may not reflect figures published by the Youth Justice Board due to differences in extraction time. The figures provided may not necessarily match the monthly custody figures within the Youth Custody Data publication (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/youth-custody-data) . This is due to different methodologies and snapshot dates.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
